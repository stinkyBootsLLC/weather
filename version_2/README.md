# OpenWeatherPy

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Purpose

Created for educational purposes only. I wanted to create a web app using the python flask framework.  I needed the application to be simple and cover the basics of using flask.  I created the original vers 1, to replace a html widget for a work project. It was a prototype and never implemented (I got a job somewhere else). I am currently in a dept. wide python training program (self pased) and working on seperate python projects not related to web technologies. This one was just for me and just for fun.
